CONFIG FILES olfactometer_yaml.py uses yml configuration files. When writing those files, their structure needs to be preserved, as per the following template:

##############################################################

parameters: # All the following parameters need to be specified. port: "com3" #Name of the port through which the instrument is connected to the computer constant_flow_channel_id: 0Channel that will give constant flow (typically 0) constant_flow_rate: 2 #Constant flow rate in SPLM calibration: no #Whether or not olfactometer_yaml.py has to calibrate the channels (yes/no)

step1: seconds: 20 #Time in seconds that this step will run for (always +10 to catch up) channels: # Nothing after the colon. on the lines below 1: 1 # CHANNEL_ID: FLOW 2: 1 3: 1

step2: seconds: 20 #Time in seconds that this step will run for (always +10 to catch up) channels: # Nothing after the colon. on the lines below 4: 1 # CHANNEL_ID: FLOW 5: 1 6: 1 #################################################################

Note the indents (spaces) before the different parameters, or seconds, or channels and then the indents before the specified channels. Those need to be preserved too.
