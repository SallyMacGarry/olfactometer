# In this experiment there are 5 concentrations of ethanol in two volumes 
# All channels will be run at low, medium and high flow rates equating to 3 runs within the experiment

# calibrate all channels to low flow rate 
# set up for experiment (press X to proceed..?) 
# open all channels sequentially for (?) 
# flush lines with clean cycle? 

# calibrate all channels to medium  flow rate 
# set up for experiment (press X to proceed..?) 
# open all channels sequentially for (?) 
# flush lines with clean cycle? 

# calibrate all channels to high flow rate 
# set up for experiment (press X to proceed..?) 
# open all channels sequentially for (?) 
# flush lines with clean cycle
